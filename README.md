# NetStruck

 This is a copycat Criterionchannel.com webpage with some additional tweaks I made out of ux concern. For example, I preferred the Netflix approach to the responsiveness of the sliders and tiles, so I replicated that. I also decided to use percentage padding to handle the responsiveness of the carousel. CriterionChannel uses a window resize event, which I find too expensive to be worth the effect. A CSS scrum was used to keep the text legible over the carousel.

 This project was created with ReactJS as a single-page application. Tailwind CSS is the style framework. Additional css is written with PostCSS, which seems more natural than SASS in this environment. All icons are from icomoon.com. The favicon was generated with https://favicon.io/. All of the movie lists are local js files created by me. The film images are sourced from https://www.themoviedb.org.
